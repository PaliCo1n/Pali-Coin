        States must not provide assistance

      <p className="text-left p-2 text-gray-600">
        Explaining the commission paper, Ms. Pillay said that States must
        demonstrate how their dealings differ regarding Israel and the Occupied
        Palestinian Territory. As an example, she noted that a State must not
        recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or place its diplomatic
        representatives to Israel in Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim as the
        capital of their future State. In addition, States must not render aid
        or assistance in maintaining the unlawful occupation, which includes
        financial, military and political aid or support, the commission chair
        said.

        How the UN can implement action

      <p className="text-left p-2 text-gray-600">
        The paper also details how the General Assembly and the Security Council
        can identify and implement the precise actions required to bring the
        occupation to an end as rapidly as possible. The commission found that
        the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the
        legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in
        the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, is
        authoritative and unambiguous in stating that Israel continued presence
        in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The commission has
        always stated that the root cause of the protracted conflict and cycles
        of violence is the occupation, Ms. Pillay said, noting that its 2022
        report to the General Assembly had concluded that the occupation is
        unlawful under international law. ‚ÄúThe Commission welcomed the historic
        advisory opinion from the highest court in the United Nations system,‚Äù
        she said.

        ‚ÄúIt is incumbent on all States to work cooperatively in order bring the
        unlawful occupation to an end and to work towards the full realisation
        of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,‚Äù Ms.
        Pillay said, calling on all States to implement the General Assembly
        resolution passed on 13 September 2024. On 17 September, the General

        during its 10th emergency special session calling for an end to Israeli
        occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory within one year., The

        ‚Äúinvestigate, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East
        Jerusalem, and in Israel, all alleged violations of international
        humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international
